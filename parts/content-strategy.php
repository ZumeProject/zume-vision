                <p>How he lived. What he said. How he loved. Everything. In this, we aspire to be marked by immediate, radical, costly obedience to Jesus, like the heroes of the faith that came before us.</p>
                <p>Jesus is both our measurement and His Spirit is our hope to become like Him. And the day we see
                    kingdom fruit surrounding our lives and the lives of our friends, family, and cities ... it will be because his Spirit has
                    moved through us.</p>
